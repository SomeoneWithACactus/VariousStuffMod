    <description>Hello! This is my first mod ever! It's a very small one, but I really hope you all like it!!!

This mod adds:

-7 New items
-1 New trinket (LANCER)
-A few new room until depths
-And a new playable Character with their tainted!
(Both Characters are based of my partner oc's! You can find him on twitter as @verdejunkrat on twitter and @verdejunkrat.bsky.social on BlueSky!)

I want to add more content on the future, so, any suggestion or critism about the mod is really appreciated!!!</description>
