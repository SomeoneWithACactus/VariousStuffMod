THANK YOU A LOT FOR PLAYING THIS MOD!!!

This was a little thing I made just for fun and interest on making a mod of my own! It's a really small mod, but I really hope you enjoy it! :3

Also Credits to my boyfriend (@verdejunkrat on twitter and @verdejunkrat.bsky.social on BlueSky!) because he is the creator of the two Oc's
which the playable characters from this mod were based of, Rachel and Reiko! And because he helped me a lot while thinking of ideas for the items that
are in the mod and the ones we want to add on possibles next updates!!!

with that said, thank you so much again for playing! And if you want to see a better description for the items in this mod, check the txt file named
Items description! Aaand that's all! Hope you enjoyed the mod! :D
